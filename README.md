LibraryCRM
==========
*I'm itchin'... I got to scratch*

So yeah, this maybe-eventually-will be a [CRM](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Customer_relationship_management) system for libraries -- a way to keep
track of which faculty member is working on what project, or students, or public patrons, or whatever. There are a lot of existing CRM systems floating around, [some](http://fatfreecrm.com) of them even free and intriguing, but they're not really appropriate for a library context as they're focused on sales, money, things like that. 

What's here now
---------------

Mindmaps, notes mostly. I'm still trying to figure out if this is even *possible* (for me), so I'm trying to think small. Pretty sure that if I do do this it'll be in [Rails](http://rubyonrails.org), so I'm working from that assumption. So that means thinking about [MVC](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Model%E2%80%93view%E2%80%93controller) type stuff. If you see anything totally wrong in my notes, please let me know.

I don't like the title.
